abstract = {This article presents a method for solving decision in building plan design by using mathematical model (nonlinear programming). First objective is to formulate mathematical models for analysis in dividing rooms and dimensions in a building plan. Secondly, to calculate the dimensions and room sizes which have minimum construction cost. A case study of a condominium building plan was analyzed in this research. The results found application of the mathematical model was applicable. The mathematical models were formulated, the minimum construction cost was 723,000 (US$24,100) and usable area in the condominium was 67.5 m2 and followed the assigned design constraints.}
